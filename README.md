# rex
Provides a class 'Rex' for describing regular expression patterns in normal english. This is a pet-project that I hope to develop into a reliable tool over time. In the future, I aim to add some powerful debugging features to introspect the Rex expression and notify the developer of bugs in the expression. Ultimately, I intend for this library to allow new programmers to use regular expressions in their projects and educate them on what they are and how they work. WARNING: This library is not production-ready and should only be used for practice and exploration. Contributions are most welcome.
